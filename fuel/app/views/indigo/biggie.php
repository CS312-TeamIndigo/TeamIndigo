            Biggie Smalls is the best 90s rapper. He revolutionized the hip-hop genre by introducing
            a new type of flow. He was able to allow for more intricate rhyming schemes that could
            have multiple rhymes in the same line. This type of rapping was very rare up until that point
            , and while he may not have been the first, he was definitely one of the most popular.
            The entire hip-hop community thanks him.

            Biggie created 7 albums. A couple of my favorite songs are "Machine Gun Funk" and "Juicy".
            Unfortunately, Biggie was shot and killed in Los Angeles in 1997. To this day, there is a lot
            of speculation around his murder. This speculation is further fueled by 2Pac's death which was
            also a murder. R.I.P Biggie and 2Pac.
