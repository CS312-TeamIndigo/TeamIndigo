        <p> Kendrick Lamar is the greatest of all-time (GOAT). I try to remain opened-minded on that fact, and I can't
            find a single rapper that can match Kendrick. His creativity mixed with his talent of the craft is so
            good that even some artists that I'm more partial to, to me objectively, aren't as good. I am looking
            forward to his next album.
        </p>
        <p> Kendrick has created 10 albums. My top three are "To Pimp a Butterfly", "good kid, m.A.A.d city", and "Overly Dedicated" 
            in that order. The way that he creates his albums makes the entire thing an experience. He takes time and effort
            to ensure that his artworks have themes and metaphors to tie the audience into the entire thing rather than just the music.
