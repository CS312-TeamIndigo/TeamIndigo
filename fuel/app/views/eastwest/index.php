        <p> Hip-hop is by far my favorite genre of music. While I am and avid listener of a lot of different
        types of music, hip-hop has definitely brought me the most joy in life. The expression that can be had
        with the art of this music is incredible. The vastness of the genre has made it one of the most popular
        genres in the country. Because of the big impact that hip-hop has made on me, I will be sharing my top 
        two favorite artists on the East side of this website.
        </p>
        <p> My two favorite rappers are Kendrick Lamar and The Notorious B.I.G (aka Biggie Smalls). Both of them 
            are the best in the game at being able to create super interesting rhyming schemes while also making 
            creative music. While I tend to gravitate more towards this kind of music, I don't think that newer
            age style of rap doesn't have any merit. Kendrick and Biggie just happen to be better.
